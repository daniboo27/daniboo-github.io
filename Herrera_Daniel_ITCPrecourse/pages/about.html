        <h1>About me</h1> <br>

          <P>hello there my name is Daniel Herrera. i'm from Honduras, make aliyah to israel in 2014<br>
            
              im start to be interesting in programming in a while, i love PC, gaming and create all kind of stuff. what i really love of coding It takes literally nothing to get started: <br>
              <br>

              Other lucrative careers are tough, a civil engineer cannot be a real estate developer because it needs huge sums of capital, a medical student also needs an investment to setup his own clinic. However , to get started with coding you just need a crappy laptop and a cheap internet connection and you can build the most viral app and turn that into a huge company. <br>
              <br>

              It's not just code: <br>
              <br>

              Coding is not just typing some cryptic lines on the computer, it solves real world issues. I am able to forward this content to my followers only because coding has empowered us well to communicate in an efficient way as human beings. <br>
              <br>

              You can literally write code which can help people from the rural areas to order items from other countries, accept payments, connect, share & collaborate. Coding has a lot to offer. <br>
              <br>

              Makes our lives easier: <br>
              <br>

              Don't want to drive in traffic, we have Uber<br>
              <br>

              Want to pre-book a villa, we have Airbnb. <br>
              <br>

              Want to order food, we have plenty of apps for that as well. <br>
              <br>

              and the list continues!!<br>
              <br>

              Imagine if coding didn't exist, we wouldn't have any of these things. <br>
              <br>

              Age is not the bar: <br>
              <br>

              People at any age can begin to code, there is no restrictions. Coding empowers even a teenage kid who can now literally change not only his but our future as well. <br>
              <br>

              I can literally keep writing and still I won't be able to even cover half the reasons why I love coding. <br>
              <br>
              </P>
